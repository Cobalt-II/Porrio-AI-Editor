# Porrio-AI-Editor
This is an attempt at a basic Florr.io AI editor. Models are extremely simplistic and as of now it's only partially done. Still have to add camera movement and a few others things. For now though, I have one enemy I made called Tornado, which is basically just a circular Sandstorm with pull effects. I also have a commented out example of targetting code in the Tornado's AI coding, so if you want to make your own AI that chases based off of player position, a full targetting system is commented out so that you can do that with ease.
